# loan-deafult-prediction

# Overview
This project involves a deep dive into the world of financial analytics, where I step into the role of a data analyst at a financial institution. My task is to leverage machine learning to predict loan defaults, a crucial aspect of risk management in finance.

# Case Study
I am working with a dataset containing information about borrowers' loan repayment behaviors. This includes data on borrowers' demographics, financial backgrounds, loan characteristics, and credit histories. My objective is to analyze this dataset to predict which borrowers are likely to default on their loans.

By performing predictive analytics, I aim to identify patterns, anomalies, and correlations in the data that can predict loan defaults. This analysis will empower the institution to make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and potentially minimize financial risks. The insights gained from this project will not only aid in enhancing loan servicing but also contribute to a more stable financial environment.

# Prerequisites
To embark on this project, a foundational knowledge of Python and data science libraries is essential. The specific packages used in the analysis are:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical computing.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- seaborn: For data visualization based on matplotlib.

These packages are typically pre-installed in Python data science environments. If additional packages are needed, they can be installed using !pip install packagename in a Jupyter Notebook cell.

# Project Objectives
- Utilize Python to preprocess, explore, and analyze loan data.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on data-driven analysis.
  
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes data from a financial institution on individual loan borrowers. It spans various attributes that are critical in assessing the likelihood of a loan default. The dataset is structured into two main files: train.csv for model training and test.csv for model testing. Key columns in the dataset include:

- Age: The age of the borrower.
- Annual Income: The annual income of the borrower.
- Loan Amount: The amount of money being borrowed.
- Credit Score: The credit score of the borrower, indicating their creditworthiness.
- Employment Duration: The number of months the borrower has been employed.
- Debt-to-Income Ratio: Indicating the borrower's debt compared to their income.
- Education Level: The highest level of education attained by the borrower.
- Marital Status: The marital status of the borrower.
- Mortgage Status: Whether the borrower has a mortgage.
- Loan Purpose: The purpose of the loan (e.g., Home, Auto, Education).
- Default: A binary variable indicating whether the loan defaulted (1) or not (0).

This comprehensive dataset allows for a detailed analysis of factors influencing loan repayment behaviors, essential for predicting loan defaults.
